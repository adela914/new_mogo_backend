This app is new version of my Mogo side project.
Mogo is for people who would like to know more about Korean restaurants in Berlin.
I started from the scratch again and used different stacks than the first version of it, in order to widen my knowledge and practice more new tech stacks.

For this project, I used Typescript, Graphql, MongoDB, Webpack and Apollo.
Currently only backend part is partially done and still in progress.
