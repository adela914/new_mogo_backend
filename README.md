# New Mogo ðŸ¥˜
Mogo means "Eat!" in Korean. This application is for people who have a craving for good authentic Korean Restaurants in Berlin. In this application people can share their favorite restaurants and their opinions about the restaurants.

This app is the new version of my Mogo side project. (Click [here](https://github.com/adela914/mogo) to see the first version!)
I started from the scratch again and used different stacks than the first version of it, in order to widen my knowledge and practice new tech stacks.

Currently only backend part is partially done and still in progress.

## Backend Tech Stacks
```
Typescript, Graphql, MongoDB, Webpack and Apollo.
```
